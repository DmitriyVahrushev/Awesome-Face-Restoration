# Awesome Face Restoration
A curated list of recources (papers, repositories etc.) about face restoration / face hallucination methods / face super-resolution methods. Feel free to contribute to this list.

# What is face restoration and face hallucination?
Face hallucination refers to any super-resolution technique which applies specifically to faces. It comprises techniques which take noisy or low-resolution facial images, and convert them into high-resolution images using knowledge about typical facial features. [From Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_hallucination)
